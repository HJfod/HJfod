## Welcome to my profile!

I am a 17-year-old hobby developer from Finland, mainly focused on developing add-ons and mods for [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/).

# My main projects

## GDShare

Tool for exporting GD levels as files!

I'm working on a new client with an all-new UI and vastly more efficient and reliable backend.

### Version 2 ETA: Early 2021

The [original version](https://github.com/HJfod/gdshare) is not being updated at the moment and will be deprecated once the new client is finished.

## ModLdr

Geometry Dash mod loader based on Adaf's GDDLLLoader.

## BetterEdit

A mod that enables collabing live in the GD editor with other people.

### Not even barely in an usable state lol

## Proton

A (shitty) text editor with limited rich text functionality.

Mainly used by me to write my video scripts, though I want to make a better version at some point.
