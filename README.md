## Welcome to my profile!

I am an 18-year-old hobby developer from Finland, mainly focused on developing add-ons and mods for [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/).

# My main projects

All of my projects are available for download on [my Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/K9Kuh3hzTC)!

## BetterEdit

A mod that adds a ton of quality-of-life features to the GD editor, like typing in HSV, advanced scaling, template building, auto-saving etc.

[Check it out!](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit)

## GDShare

Mod for exporting GD levels as files!

**The [original version](https://github.com/HJfod/gdshare) has been deprecated and should no longer be used.**

## ModLdr

Geometry Dash mod loader based on Adaf's GDDLLLoader.

## Proton

A (shitty) text editor with limited rich text functionality.

Mainly used by me to write my video scripts, though I want to make a better version at some point.
